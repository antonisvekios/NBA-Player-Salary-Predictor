# **Predicting NBA Player Salaries Based on Performance Statistics**
A python project that uses different machine learning algorithms in order to predict the salary of all NBA players based on their performance statistics. Provides insight on overpaid and underpaid players by identifying players whose salaries vary greatly from their predicted salaries.

# **Overview**
It seems that every year there are some seemingly outrageous player contracts in the NBA where player's are marginally overpaid or underpaid. In an attempt to understand the rationale behind a player's salary, [we retrieved statistics and salaries from basketballreference.com for the 2020-2021 NBA season](#data).
 We handled the data and plotted [several graphs](#graphs) to visualize the correlation between various statistics and NBA player salary. Using the data from basketballreference.com, we used machine learning techniques including [Lasso](#lasso) with built-in capabilities to ignore redudant statistics and [Random Forest Regression](#rf) to predict feature importance and create models to predict NBA player salary. The results of our models provide [fascinating insights](#insights) into the worth of player contracts and depict that there is undoubtedly a connection between certain statistics and a player's salary. However, it is important to recognize that our models are not perfect, and fail to encompass all the variables relevant for determining a player's salary.
